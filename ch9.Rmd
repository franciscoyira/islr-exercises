## Conceptual

(1) This problem involves hyperplanes in two dimensions.

(2) We have seen that in $p = 2$ dimensions, a linear decision boundary takes the form $β_0+β_1X_1+β_2X_2 = 0$. We now investigate a non-linear decision boundary.

All observations except (-1,1) are assigned to the blue class. 

(d) Argue that while the decision boundary in (c) is not linear in terms of $X_1$ and $X_2$, it is linear in terms of $X_1, X_1^2, X_2$ and $X_2^2$.

We can see this by expanding the equation of the boundary. Doing this we arrive get the following expression, which is clearly linear in terms of $X_1, X_1^2, X_2$ and $X_2^2$.
