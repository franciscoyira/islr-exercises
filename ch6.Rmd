## Conceptual

(1) We perform best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection on a single data set. For each approach, we obtain $p + 1$
models, containing $0, 1, 2, ..., p$ predictors. Explain your answers:

(a) Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest training RSS?

A: Best subset selection should have the smallest training RSS (or at least equal to others methods), because it will check all the combinations with k predictors, that is $\binom nk$ combinations. Forward and backward stepwise, instead, will check only a subset of those combinations ($p-k+1$ in forward selection and $k+1$ in backward selection).

(b) Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest test RSS?

A: Again, best subset selection should provide the model with smallest test RSS, simply because it checks more combinations of predictors. However, since there is chance involved in the test RSS, stepwise could provide a model with lower test RSS in some rare cases.

(c) True or False: 

i. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the $(k+1)$-variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.

TRUE

ii. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the $(k +1)$-variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.

TRUE

iii. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the $(k +1)$-variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.

FALSE

iv. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the $(k+1)$-variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.

FALSE

v. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by best subset are a subset of the predictors in the $(k +1)$-variable model identified by best subset selection.

FALSE

(2) For parts (a) through (c), indicate which of i. through iv. is correct. Justify your answer.

(a) The lasso, relative to least squares, is: 

i. More flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance.

ii. More flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in variance is less than its decrease in bias.

iii. Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance.

iv. Less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in variance is less than its decrease in bias.

A: (iii) is correct. Lasso increases bias by introducing a "budget restriction" on coefficients that shrinks their value (and even can set some of them as zero). This leads to more bias, which is accepted to the extent that there is a larger decrease in variance (due to less overfitting to the training sample).

(b) Repeat (a) for ridge regression relative to least squares.

A: (iii) is correct. For the same reasons stated for the lasso regression (the only difference between the lasso and ridge is the "shape" of the constrain on the coefficients).

(c) Repeat (a) for non-linear methods relative to least squares.

A: (ii) is correct. Non-linear methods provide more flexibility than least squares, hence they can reduce bias, at the expense of higher variance. If the true relationship in the data is non linear, we can expect an improvement in prediction accuracy (the reduction in bias will be larger than the increase in variance).

(3) Suppose we estimate the regression coefficients in a linear regression model by minimizing

![](ch6_files/chapter6_1.png)

for a particular value of s. For parts (a) through (e), indicate which of i. through v. is correct. Justify your answer.

(a) As we increase s from 0, the training RSS will: 

i. Increase initially, and then eventually start decreasing in an inverted U shape.

ii. Decrease initially, and then eventually start increasing in a Ushape.

iii. Steadily increase. 

iv. Steadily decrease.

v. Remain constant

A: (iv) Steadily decrease. The flexibility of the model increses as $s$ increases, and higher flexibility is always associated with lower training RSS.

(b) Repeat (a) for test RSS.

A: (ii) The test RSS will decrease as long as the increase in variance (due to higher flexibility) is smaller than the reduction in bias. At some point (which depends on the true relationships in the data) the trend will invert, because the reduction in bias will no longer offset the increase in variance.

(c) Repeat (a) for variance.

A: (iii) Variance always increases as there is more flexibility.

(d) Repeat (a) for (squared) bias.

A: (iv) Bias should decrease, or at least remain constant, as the flexibility increases.

(e) Repeat (a) for the irreducible error.

A: (v). The irreducible error doesn't depend on the flexibility of the model.

(4) Suppose we estimate the regression coefficients in a linear regression model by minimizing

![](ch6_files/chapter6_2.png)

for a particular value of λ. For parts (a) through (e), indicate which
of i. through v. is correct. Justify your answer.

(a) As we increase λ from 0, the training RSS will: 

i. Increase initially, and then eventually start decreasing in an inverted U shape.

ii. Decrease initially, and then eventually start increasing in a Ushape.

iii. Steadily increase. 

iv. Steadily decrease. 

v. Remain constant.

A: (iii) An increase in $\lambda$ implies  a decrease in flexibility (model with $\lambda = 0$ has the same flexibility as OLS, and model with $\lambda = \infty$ is regression with just the intercept). So the training RSS will increase as $\lambda$ increases (and flexibility decreases).

(b) Repeat (a) for test RSS. 

A: (ii) Lower flexibility has the benefit of reducing variance, at the expense of increasing bias. We should expect the reduction in variance to offset the increase in bias for a range, reach a minimum in total test RSS, and then see the trend reversed.

(c) Repeat (a) for variance. 

A: (iv) Variance always decreases as flexibility decreases.

(d) Repeat (a) for (squared) bias.

A: (iii) As $\lambda$ gets higher, the model is more constrained, so the error due to bias increases.

(e) Repeat (a) for the irreducible error.

A: (v). The irreducible error doesn't depend on the flexibility of the model.

(5) It is well-known that ridge regression tends to give similar coefficient values to correlated variables, whereas the lasso may give quite different coefficient values to correlated variables. We will now explore this property in a very simple setting.

Suppose that $n =2$, $p =2$, $x_{11} = x_{12}$, $x_{21} = x_{22}$.Furthermore, suppose that $y1+y2 = 0$ and $x_{11} +x_{21} =0$ and $x_{12} + x_{22} = 0$, so that the estimate for the intercept in a least squares, ridge regression, or lasso model is zero: $\hat{β}_0 = 0$.

(a) Write out the ridge regression optimization problem in this setting.

![](ch6_files/chapter6_3.png)

(b) Argue that in this setting, the ridge coefficient estimates satisfy $\hat{β}_1 = \hat{β}_2$.

A: We see that the RSS part of the expression depends only on the *sum* of both coefficients (not on their individual values). For each value of the sum, there are infinite pairs of coefficients that result on that number. In this case, since there are two coefficients, those pairs form a line on the plane, with slope of minus 45°. 

The regularization part of the expression implies that we want the pair, inside that line, in which the sum of the squares of the coefficients is minimized. Geometrically, this happens in the point of the line which is tangent to the smallest circle centered in (0,0). And in this point both coefficients have equal value.

![](ch6_files/chapter6_4.png)

(c) Write out the lasso optimization problem in this setting.

![](ch6_files/chapter6_5.png)

(d) Argue that in this setting, the lasso coefficients are not unique — in other words, there are many possible solutions to the optimization problem in (c). Describe these solutions.

A: Similarly than in the previous case, here the RSS part of the expression also imposses that the coefficents must be pairs inside a line with slope of -45°. But the regularization part is different, it implies that we want pairs in the line for which the sum of their absolute values is minimized.

Geometrically, this is as having a square-shaped restriction, centered in zero, and rotated in 45° degrees. In this setting, the intersection of the line and the border of the restriction is not a point, but a whole segment of the line (which contains infinite pairs or solutions).

![](ch6_files/chapter6_6.png)

6. We will now explore (6.12) and (6.13) further. 

(a) Consider (6.12) with $p = 1$. For some choice of $y_1$ and $λ > 0$, plot (6.12) as a function of $β_1$. Your plot should confirm that (6.12) is solved by (6.14).

A: Here is the plot for $y_1 = 5$ and $\lambda = 1$. 

![](ch6_files/chapter6_7.png)

We see that in the minimum $\beta_1$ is equal to 2.5, instead of 5. This confirms the formula given in (6.14): the ridge coefficient is equal to the OLS coefficient, divided by $(1 + \lambda)$ (which is 2, in this particular case).

(b) Consider (6.13) with $p = 1$. For some choice of $y_1$ and $λ> 0$, plot (6.13) as a function of $β_1$. Your plot should confirm that
(6.13) is solved by (6.15).

![](ch6_files/chapter6_7b.png)  

We see that in the minimum $\beta_1$ is equal to 4.5, insted of 5 (the actual value of $y$). This matches the formula given in (6.15), in which if $y_i$ is higher than $\lambda/2$ (as is the case), then the lasso coefficient is equal to $y_i - \lambda/2$ (5 - 1/2, in this particular case).

(7) We will now derive the Bayesian connection to the lasso and ridge regression discussed in Section 6.2.2.

Skipped. Good solution here: https://blog.princehonest.com/stat-learning/ch6/7.html 

## Applied

(8) In this exercise, we will generate simulated data, and will then use this data to perform best subset selection.

(a) Use the `rnorm()` function to generate a predictor $X$ of length
$n = 100$, as well as a noise vector $\epsilon$ of length $n = 100$.

```{r}
set.seed(42)

x <- rnorm(100)
noise <- rnorm(100)
```

(b) Generate a response vector $Y$ of length $n = 100$ according to the model $Y = β_0 + β_1X + β_2X^2 + β_3X^3 + \epsilon$, where $β_0$, $β_1$, $β_2$,and $β_3$ are constants of your choice:

```{r}
y <- 1 + 2*x + 0.4*x^2 + 0.17*x^3 + noise
```

(c) Use the `regsubsets()` function to perform best subset selection in order to choose the best model containing the predictors $X,X^2,...,X^{10}$. What is the best model obtained according to Cp, BIC,and adjusted $R^2$? Show some plots to provide evidence for your answer, and report the coefficients of the best model obtained. 

First we create the dataframe:
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  y = y,
  x1 = x,
  x2 = x^2,
  x3 = x^3,
  x4 = x^4,
  x5 = x^5,
  x6 = x^6,
  x7 = x^7,
  x8 = x^8,
  x9 = x^9,
  x10 = x^10
)

df
```

```{r}
bestsubset <- regsubsets(x = as.matrix(select(df,-y)),
                         y = as.matrix(select(df, y))) 

summary(bestsubset)
```

Now, for each number of predictors, we have the best model. Let's compare the models with different number of predictors:
```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["adjr2"]] %>% plot()
```

```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["adjr2"]] %>% which.max()
```

```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["cp"]] %>% plot()
```

```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["cp"]] %>% which.min()
```


```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["bic"]] %>% plot()
```

```{r}
summary(bestsubset)[["bic"]] %>% which.min()
```

Based on Adj-R2 and Cp, the best model is the one with 7 variables. Based on BIC, the best is the one with 5 (both conclusions are wrong, because we generated the data using a model with 3 variables).

The coefficients for the "best" models:
```{r}
bestsubset %>% coef(id = 5)
```

```{r}
bestsubset %>% coef(id = 7)
```

(d) Repeat (c), using forward stepwise selection and also using backwards stepwise selection. How does your answer compare to the
results in (c)?

First we do forward selection:
```{r}
forwardselection <- regsubsets(x = as.matrix(select(df, -y)),
                               y = as.matrix(select(df, y)),
                               method = "forward") 

summary(forwardselection)
```

The best models, based on forward selection and chosen by Adj-R2, Cp, and BIC, are as follows:
```{r}
forwardmodels <- 
  tibble(
    metric = c("adjr2", "cp", "bic"),
    best_model = c(
      summary(forwardselection)[["adjr2"]]%>% which.max(),
      summary(forwardselection)[["cp"]] %>% which.min(),
      summary(forwardselection)[["bic"]] %>% which.min()
    )
  )

forwardmodels
```

Now with backward selection:
```{r}
backwardselection <- regsubsets(x = as.matrix(select(df,-y)),
                                y = as.matrix(select(df, y)),
                                method = "backward")

summary(backwardselection)
```

The best models, based on forward selection and chosen by Adj-R2, Cp, and BIC, are as follows:
```{r}
backwardmodels <- 
  tibble(
    metric = c("adjr2", "cp", "bic"),
    best_model = c(
      summary(backwardselection)[["adjr2"]]%>% which.max(),
      summary(backwardselection)[["cp"]] %>% which.min(),
      summary(backwardselection)[["bic"]] %>% which.min()
    )
  )

backwardmodels
```

Unfortunately, none of the feature selection methods was able to find the "true model" used to generate this data.

(e) Now fit a lasso model to the simulated data, again using $X,X^2, ...,X^{10}$ as predictors. Use cross-validation to select the optimal value of λ. Create plots of the cross-validation error as a function of λ. Report the resulting coefficient estimates, and discuss the results obtained.

Using cross validation to select the optimal value of λ.

```{r}
cv_lasso <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = as.matrix(select(df, -y)),
    y = as.matrix(select(df, y)),
    alpha = 1,
    nfolds = 10
  )

cv_lasso[["lambda.min"]]
```

Plot of CV error as function of λ:
```{r}
error_vs_lambda <- 
  tibble(
    cvm = cv_lasso[["cvm"]],
    lambdas = cv_lasso[["lambda"]]
  )

ggplot(data = error_vs_lambda) +
  geom_line(aes(lambdas, cvm)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cv_lasso[["lambda.min"]], color = "red") +
  geom_label(x = cv_lasso[["lambda.min"]], 
             y = 7, 
             label = round(cv_lasso[["lambda.min"]], 2),
             color = "red") +
  labs(y = "Mean of CV error",
       title = "Choosing lambda in lasso regression")
```

Obtaining coefficients with the optimal lambda:
```{r}
glmnet(
  x = as.matrix(select(df,-y)),
  y = as.matrix(select(df, y)),
  alpha = 1,
  lambda = cv_lasso[["lambda.min"]]
) %>% coef()
```

We see that the lasso does a much better job in selecting the features that are truly part of the data generating process. Also, the coeficient estimates are very close to the true ones (2, 0.4 and 0.17).

(f) Now generate a response vector Y according to the model $Y = β_0 + β_7X^7 + \epsilon$, and perform best subset selection and the lasso. Discuss the results obtained.

```{r}
df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(y = 1 + 2*x7 + noise)
```

```{r}
bestsubset2 <- regsubsets(
  x = as.matrix(select(df2, -y)),
  y = as.matrix(select(df2, y))
)

bestmodels2 <- 
  tibble(
    metric = c("adjr2", "cp", "bic"),
    best_model = c(
      summary(bestsubset2)[["adjr2"]]%>% which.max(),
      summary(bestsubset2)[["cp"]] %>% which.min(),
      summary(bestsubset2)[["bic"]] %>% which.min()
    )
  )

bestmodels2
```

```{r}
summary(bestsubset2)
```

Now we do feature selection using the lasso:
```{r}
cv_lasso2 <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = as.matrix(select(df2, -y)),
    y = as.matrix(select(df2, y)),
    alpha = 1,
    nfolds = 100
  )

glmnet(
  x = as.matrix(select(df2,-y)),
  y = as.matrix(select(df2, y)),
  alpha = 1,
  lambda = cv_lasso2[["lambda.min"]]
) %>% coef()
```

Again, the lasso comes closer to choosing the features that are part of the true model. However, here it incorrectly picks $X^9$ as predictor, and also estimates an intercept a bit off the true one.

(9) In this exercise, we will predict the number of applications received using the other variables in the `College` data set.

(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.
```{r}
college_train <- ISLR::College %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "name") %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 0.5)

college_test <- ISLR::College %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "name") %>% 
  anti_join(college_train, by = "name")
```

(b) Fit a linear model using least squares on the training set, and report the test error obtained.
```{r}
lm_model <- college_train %>% 
  select(-name) %>% 
  lm(Apps ~ ., data = .)

college_test %>% 
  add_predictions(model = lm_model, var = "Apps_pred") %>% 
  select(Apps, Apps_pred, everything()) %>% 
  summarise(test_mse = mean((Apps_pred-Apps)^2))
```

(c) Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained.
```{r}
grid <- c(10^seq(10, -10, length = 300),
          0)

best_lambda <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_train),
    y = as.matrix(select(college_train, Apps)),
    nfold = 300,
    alpha = 0,
    lambda = grid
  )[["lambda.min"]]

ridge_college <-
  glmnet(
    x = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_train),
    y = college_train[["Apps"]],
    alpha = 0,
    lambda = best_lambda,
    thresh =1e-12
  )

pred_apps_ridge <-
  predict.glmnet(ridge_college,
                 newx = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_test),
                 s = best_lambda)

mean((pred_apps_ridge - college_test[["Apps"]])^2)
```

I don't understand why test MSE in ridge is higher than test MSE with OLS  :(

The coefficients
```{r}
predict(ridge_college,
        type = 'coefficients',
        s = best_lambda)
```

(d) Fit a lasso model on the training set, with λ chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the number of non-zero coefficient estimates.
```{r}
best_lambda_lasso <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_train),
    y = as.matrix(select(college_train, Apps)),
    nfold = 300,
    alpha = 1,
    lambda = grid
  )[["lambda.min"]]

lasso_college <-
  glmnet(
    x = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_train),
    y = as.matrix(select(college_train, Apps)),
    alpha = 1,
    lambda = best_lambda_lasso,
    thresh =1e-12
  )

pred_apps_lasso <-
  predict.glmnet(lasso_college,
                 newx = model.matrix(Apps ~ . - name, college_test),
                 s = best_lambda_lasso)

mean((pred_apps_lasso - college_test[["Apps"]])^2)
```

It is lower than in OLS and ridge :)

The coefficients (using the whole dataset)
```{r}
full_lasso_college <-
  glmnet(
    x = model.matrix(Apps ~ ., College),
    y = as.matrix(select(College, Apps)),
    alpha = 1,
    lambda = best_lambda_lasso,
    thresh =1e-12
  )

predict(full_lasso_college, type = "coefficients",
        s = best_lambda_lasso)
```

We see that `perc_alumni` was dropped by the lasso.

(e) Fit a PCR model on the training set, with M chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value
of M selected by cross-validation.
```{r}
pcr_college <-
  pcr(Apps ~ . - name,
      data = college_train,
      scale = TRUE,
      validation = "CV")

summary(pcr_college)
```

We see that the lowest CV error is achieved when we use all the available componentes (M = 17).
```{r}
validationplot(pcr_college,val.type="MSEP")
```

The lowest CV RMSE happens with M=17. I will pick M=16 since then RMSE is very close to M=17.

Now let's check the test MSE:
```{r}
apps_pred_pcr <- 
  predict(pcr_college, newdata = college_test, ncomp = 16)

mean((apps_pred_pcr - college_test[["Apps"]])^2)
```

The test MSE is lower than in Lasso, Ridge and linear regression.

(f) Fit a PLS model on the training set, with M chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of M selected by cross-validation.
```{r}
pls_college <-
  plsr(Apps ~ . - name,
      data = college_train,
      scale = TRUE,
      validation = "CV")

summary(pls_college)
```

```{r}
validationplot(pls_college,val.type="MSEP")
```

The lower CV error is achieved with M = 10.

```{r}
apps_pred_pls <- 
  predict(pls_college, newdata = college_test, ncomp = 10)

mean((apps_pred_pls - college_test[["Apps"]])^2)
```

(g) Comment on the results obtained. How accurately can we predict the number of college applications received? Is there much difference among the test errors resulting from these five approaches?

ANSWER: It seems that PCR is the method which can more accurately predict the number of college applications in test data. However, most of the test MSE obtained are roughly similar, and there are not big improvements over the regular linear regression performance. This may suggest that the error of model comes mostly from bias, and not from variance (therefore, methods of dimensionality reduction cannot provide big improvements in error reduction).

R-squared from test data: 93% (very high)
```{r}
avg_apps <- mean(college_test[["Apps"]])

1 - mean((college_test[["Apps"]] - apps_pred_pcr)^2)/mean((college_test[["Apps"]] - avg_apps)^2)
```

(10) We have seen that as the number of features used in a model increases, the training error will necessarily decrease, but the test error may not. We will now explore this in a simulated data set.

(a) Generate a data set with $p =20$ features, $n = 1000$ observations, and an associated quantitative response vector generated according to the model $Y = Xβ + \epsilon$, where $β$ has some elements that are exactly equal to zero.
```{r}
set.seed(42)
df_sim <- 
  tibble(.rows = 1000) 

for (i in 1:20) {
  varname <- str_c("X", i)
  df_sim[[varname]] <- rnorm(1000)
}

noise <- rnorm(1000)

m_sim <- as.matrix(df_sim)

# Declare coefficients
betas <- rep(c(1,2,3,0), length.out = 20) %>% as.matrix()

y <- 
  m_sim %*% betas + noise

df_sim <- df_sim %>% 
  mutate(y = y,
         id = row_number())
```

(b) Split your data set into a training set containing 100 observations and a test set containing 900 observations
```{r}
sim_training <- df_sim %>% 
  sample_n(size = 100)

sim_test <- df_sim %>% 
  anti_join(sim_training, by = "id")
```

(c) Perform best subset selection on the training set, and plot the training set MSE associated with the best model of each size.
```{r}
sim_bestsubset <- 
  regsubsets(y ~ . -id, data = sim_training, nvmax = 20)

summary(sim_bestsubset)
```

```{r}
sim_best_rss <- summary(sim_bestsubset)[["rss"]]

sim_n_minus_m <- rep(1000, times = 20) - 2:21

sim_best_mse <- sim_best_rss/sim_n_minus_m

plot(sim_best_mse)
```

```{r}
which.min(sim_best_mse)
```

The model with the lowest training MSE is the one with most variables (p = 20).

(e) For which model size does the test set MSE take on its minimum value? Comment on your results. If it takes on its minimum value for a model containing only an intercept or a model containing all of the features, then play around with the way that you are generating the data in (a) until you come up with a scenario in which the test set MSE is minimized for an intermediate model size.

```{r}
# Model matrix for test data
sim_test_matrix <- 
  sim_test %>% model.matrix(y ~ . - id, data = .)

# Create function for obtaing test MSE for each best model
mse_for_bestsubset <- function(n_vars) {
  # Extract coefficients for each model size
  coefs_i <- sim_bestsubset %>% coef(id = n_vars)
  
  # Compute Y_predicted
  pred_i <- sim_test_matrix[, names(coefs_i)] %*% coefs_i
  
  # Obtain MSE
  mse_i <- mean((sim_test[["y"]] - pred_i) ^ 2)
  
  mse_i
}

# Iterate for 1:20 number of variables
test_mse_best <- 
  tibble(
    n_vars = 1:20,
    test_mse = map_dbl(n_vars, mse_for_bestsubset)
  )

#Plot
min_test_mse <- which.min(test_mse_best[["test_mse"]])

ggplot(test_mse_best,
       aes(n_vars, test_mse)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = min_test_mse, color = "red")
```

The minimum test MSE is achieved in the model with 15 variables (plus the intercept). 

(f) How does the model at which the test set MSE is minimized compare to the true model used to generate the data? Comment on the coefficient values.

ANSWER: In this case, the best subset algorithm correctly chooses a model that includes all the true predictors, and only the true predictors.  

Also, the estimated coefficients are very close to the true ones (used for generating the data).

```{r}
coef(sim_bestsubset, id = 15)
```

(g) Create a plot displaying of $\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p(\beta_j-\hat{\beta}_j^r)^2}$ for a range of values of $r$, where $\hat{\beta}_j^r$ is the jth coefficient estimate for the best model containing $r$ coefficients. Comment on what you observe. How does this compare to the test MSE plot from (d)?
```{r}
# Names of all the variables
names_betas <- 
  coef(sim_bestsubset, id = 20) %>% names()

# Create vector with true coefficients + their names
betas_named <- c(0, as.vector(betas)) %>% 
  set_names(names_betas)

error_coeffs <- function(r) {
  zeros <- rep(0, times = 21) %>%
    set_names(names_betas)
  
  coefs_r <-
    coef(sim_bestsubset, id = r)
  
  zeros[names(coefs_r)] <- coefs_r
  
  ((betas_named - zeros) ^ 2) %>% sum() %>% sqrt()
  
}

test_mse_best <- test_mse_best %>% 
  mutate(error_coeffs = map_dbl(n_vars, error_coeffs)) 

ggplot(test_mse_best) +
  geom_line(aes(x = n_vars, y = error_coeffs)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = which.min(test_mse_best[["error_coeffs"]]),
             color = "red")
```

This result matches what we get in (d), the model that minimizes the MSE in predictions, and also the error coefficient estimates, is the one with r = 15 (i.e. the best model containing 15 coefficients).

(11) We will now try to predict per capita crime rate in the `Boston` data set.

(a) Try out some of the regression methods explored in this chapter, such as best subset selection, the lasso, ridge regression, and PCR. Present and discuss results for the approaches that you consider.

(b) Propose a model (or set of models) that seem to perform well on this data set, and justify your answer. Make sure that you are evaluating model performance using validation set error, crossvalidation, or some other reasonable alternative, as opposed to using training error.

(c) Does your chosen model involve all of the features in the data set? Why or why not?

```{r}
(boston <- MASS::Boston %>% as_tibble())
```

First lets split the data into training and test set.
```{r}
boston_training <- boston %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 0.5)

boston_test <- boston %>% 
  anti_join(boston_training)
```

Best subset selection:
```{r}
crim_mod_best <- 
  regsubsets(crim ~ ., data = boston_training, nvmax = 13)

summary(crim_mod_best)
```

Comparing "best subset" models for different number of variables:
```{r}
best_sub_models <- 
  tibble(
    nvars = 1:13
  )

boston_test_matrix <- model.matrix(crim ~ ., data = boston_test)

# Function to compute test MSE
mse_for_bestsubset_boston <- function(n_vars) {
  # Extract coefficients for each model size
  coefs_i <- crim_mod_best %>% coef(id = n_vars)
  
  # Compute Y_predicted
  pred_i <- boston_test_matrix[, names(coefs_i)] %*% coefs_i
  
  # Obtain MSE
  mse_i <- mean((boston_test[["crim"]] - pred_i) ^ 2)
  
  mse_i
}

best_sub_models <- best_sub_models %>% 
  mutate(mse = map_dbl(nvars, mse_for_bestsubset_boston))

ggplot(best_sub_models, aes(nvars, mse)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = which.min(best_sub_models[["mse"]]),
             color = "red")
```

I'm obtaining weird results with test/training spliting, so I'm going to use cross-validation to find the optimum model size:
```{r}
set.seed(42)
# Split original dataset into 10 folds
boston_cv <- boston %>% 
  mutate(fold = sample(1:10, nrow(boston), replace = TRUE))

# Declaring function
mse_cv_bestsubsets_boston <- function(n_vars, fold_i) {
  # Split in train/test according to fold
  boston_cv_train <-
    boston_cv %>%
    filter(fold != fold_i)
  
  boston_cv_test <-
    boston_cv %>%
    filter(fold == fold_i)
  
  boston_cv_test_matrix <- model.matrix(crim ~ ., boston_cv_test)
  
  # Train best-subsets
  cv_bestsubset <- regsubsets(crim ~ ., data = boston_cv_train, nvmax = 13) 
  
  # Extract coefficients by model size
  coefs_i <- cv_bestsubset %>% coef(id = n_vars)
  
  # Compute Y_predicted
  pred_i <- boston_cv_test_matrix[, names(coefs_i)] %*% coefs_i
  
  # Obtain MSE
  mse_i <- mean((boston_cv_test[["crim"]] - pred_i) ^ 2)
  
  mse_i
}

cv_best_subsets <- 
  expand_grid(n_vars = 1:13, fold_i = 1:10) %>% 
  mutate(mse = map2_dbl(n_vars, fold_i, mse_cv_bestsubsets_boston)) %>% 
  group_by(n_vars) %>% 
  summarise(mse = mean(mse))

ggplot(cv_best_subsets, aes(n_vars, mse)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = which.min(cv_best_subsets[["mse"]]),
             color = "red")
```

Therefore, we conclude that the optimal model size is 9 variables/predictors. This is the Test MSE for a model of that size, in `boston_test`. 
```{r}
best_subset_mse <- 
  mse_for_bestsubset_boston(9)

best_subset_mse
```

Now let's try lasso (alpha = 1).
First finding alpha through CV:
```{r}
boston_train_m <- model.matrix(crim ~ ., data = boston_training)
lambda_seq <- 10^seq(10, -10, length.out = 400)

cv_lambda_boston <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = boston_train_m,
    y = boston_training[["crim"]],
    lambda = lambda_seq,
    nfold = 10,
    alpha = 1
  )


best_lambda_boston <- cv_lambda_boston$lambda.min

boston_lasso <- 
  glmnet(
    x = boston_train_m,
    y = boston_training[["crim"]],
    lambda = best_lambda_boston,
    alpha = 1
  )
```

Now let's estimate the Test MSE:
```{r}
boston_test_m <- model.matrix(crim ~ ., data = boston_test)

crim_boston_lasso <- 
  predict.glmnet(boston_lasso, newx = boston_test_m, s = best_lambda_boston)

lasso_mse <- 
  mean((crim_boston_lasso - boston_test[["crim"]])^2)

lasso_mse
```

It's slightly higher than the Best Subset MSE.

Now with ridge:
```{r}
cv_lambda_boston_ridge <-
  cv.glmnet(
    x = boston_train_m,
    y = boston_training[["crim"]],
    lambda = lambda_seq,
    nfold = 10,
    alpha = 0
  )

best_lambda_boston_ridge <- cv_lambda_boston_ridge$lambda.min

boston_ridge <- 
  glmnet(
    x = boston_train_m,
    y = boston_training[["crim"]],
    lambda = best_lambda_boston_ridge,
    alpha = 0
  )

crim_boston_ridge <- 
  predict.glmnet(boston_ridge, newx = boston_test_m, 
                 s = best_lambda_boston_ridge)

ridge_mse <- 
  mean((crim_boston_ridge - boston_test[["crim"]])^2)

ridge_mse

```

Slightly higher than Lasso MSE.

Now with PCR:
```{r}
boston_pcr <- 
  pcr(crim ~ .,
      data = boston_training,
      scale = TRUE,
      validation = "CV")

summary(boston_pcr)
```

I will use 4 components, because the CV MSE barely moves when including more components after that.

```{r}
boston_pcr_train <- 
  pcr(crim ~ .,
      data = boston_training,
      scale = TRUE)

crim_pcr <- predict(boston_pcr_train, newx = boston_test, ncomp = 4)

pcr_mse <- mean((crim_pcr - boston_test[["crim"]])^2)

pcr_mse
```

Based on the previous results, I would choose the Ridge regression (the model with the lowest test MSE). It uses all the variables in the data (since ridge doesn't perform feature selection), but shrinks the coefficient values, based on the regularization term and the optimal lambda value.
```{r}
boston_ridge %>% predict.glmnet(type = "coefficients")
```
