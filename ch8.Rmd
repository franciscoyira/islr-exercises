## Conceptual

(1) Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of two dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all aspects of your figures, including the regions $R_1, R_2, ...$,the cutpoints $t_1,t_2, ...$, and so forth.

(2) It is mentioned in Section 8.2.3 that boosting using depth-one trees (or stumps) leads to an additive model: that is, a model of the form

![](ch8_files/exc2_instr.png)

Explain why this is the case. You can begin with (8.12) in Algorithm 8.2.

A: The key to understand why a boosting based on stumps can be expressed as an additive model is that in the original formula of boosting:

![](ch8_files/exc2_1.png)

Each tree is a function of the whole vector of predictors ($X$) but in this case, each tree (stump) is a function of just one predictor:

![](ch8_files/exc2_2.png) 

So, we can classify all the $B$ stumps that are added in the original boosting formula into "sets" or "groups" based on the predictor which each of them uses:

![](ch8_files/exc2_3.png) 

And then we can "summarise" each of these groups as functions that are defined as summations of the stumps based on the same predictor. For each case, the resulting function also depends only on the single predictor.

![](ch8_files/exc2_4.png) 

After rewriting all the stumps as these functions, we can add them up to get the formula presented at the beginning of the exercise.

(3) Consider the Gini index, classification error, and cross-entropy in a simple classification setting with two classes. Create a single plot that displays each of these quantities as a function of $\hat{p}_{m1}$.The x-axis should display $\hat{p}_{m1}$, ranging from 0 to 1, and the y-axis should display the value of the Gini index, classification error, and entropy.

Hint: In a setting with two classes, $\hat{p}_{m1} = 1âˆ’ \hat{p}_{m2}$

```{r}
gini_twoclasses <- function(x, y) {
  x*(1-x) + y*(1-y)
}

xentropy_twoclasses <- function(x, y) {
 -(x*log(x) + y*log(y))
}

c_error_two_classes <- function(x, y) {
  1 - max(x, y)
}


simulated_data <- 
  tibble(
    pm1 = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000),
    pm2 = 1 - pm1,
    gini = gini_twoclasses(pm1, pm2),
    xentropy = xentropy_twoclasses(pm1, pm2),
    clasif_error = map2_dbl(pm1, pm2, c_error_two_classes)
  )

simulated_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(gini, xentropy, clasif_error),
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pm1, value, color = metric)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "prop. of obs. in class 1")
```

(4) This question relates to the plots in Figure 8.12. 

(a) Sketch the tree corresponding to the partition of the predictor space illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 8.12. The numbers inside the boxes indicate the mean of Y within each region.

![](ch8_files/exc4_1.png)

(b) Create a diagram similar to the left-hand panel of Figure 8.12, using the tree illustrated in the right-hand panel of the same figure. You should divide up the predictor space into the correct regions, and indicate the mean for each region.

![](ch8_files/exc4_2.png)

(5) Suppose we produce ten bootstrapped samples from a data set containing red and green classes. We then apply a classification tree to each bootstrapped sample and, for a specific value of X, produce 10 estimates of P(Class is Red|X):

0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.55, 0.6, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, and 0.75.

There are two common ways to combine these results together into a single class prediction. One is the majority vote approach discussed in this chapter. The second approach is to classify based on the average probability. In this example, what is the final classification under each of these two approaches?

A: assuming a threshold in 0.5, using the majority vote the final classification would be "Red", but using the average probability the final classification would be "Green" (average probability is 0.45).

(6) Provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm that is used to fit a regression tree.

A: Let's consider $P$ predictors and a response variable Y. 

The algorithm sets the RSS formula as objective function and checks all the combinations of $p$ and $s$, where $p$ is an individual predictor, and $s$ a specific value in the domain of that predictor. 

Then chooses the combination for which, after doing a split on $s$ based on the predictor $p$, the RSS is reduced the most.

The process is repeated until a stopping criterion is achieved.

## Applied

(7) In the lab, we applied random forests to the `Boston` data using `mtry=6` and using `ntree=25` and `ntree=500`. Create a plot displaying the test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more comprehensive range of values for `mtry` and `ntree` You can model your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.

Split into training and validation:
```{r}
set.seed(1989)

boston_train <- Boston %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  sample_frac(0.5)

boston_test <- Boston %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  anti_join(boston_train)
```

Train random forests using different values for `mtry` and `ntree`
```{r}
rf_with_params <- 
  crossing(
    m = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13),
    ntrees = seq(from = 1, to = 500, by = 3)
  )
```

Function to train RF on training data and obtain MSE in test data
```{r}
get_mse_rf_boston <- function(m, ntrees) {
  rf_trained <- randomForest(medv ~ ., data = boston_train,
                                  mtry = m, ntree = ntrees, importance = TRUE)
  
boston_test_pred <- boston_test %>% 
  add_predictions(rf_trained, var = "pred")

print(m)  

  mean((boston_test_pred$pred - boston_test$medv)^2)
  
}
```

Get test and plot
```{r}
rf_with_params <- rf_with_params %>% 
  mutate(test_mse = map2_dbl(m, ntrees, get_mse_rf_boston))
```


```{r, fig.asp=2}
rf_with_params %>%
#   group_by(m) %>% 
#   arrange(ntrees) %>% 
#   mutate(test_mse)
ggplot(aes(ntrees, test_mse, color = factor(m))) +
  geom_line(size = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 1.7) +
  labs(x = "Number of trees",
       y = "Test MSE",
       color = "m (from p = 13)")
```

We see that `mtry=6` leads to lower Test MSE in most of the cases. Also, the Test MSE seems to "estabilize" after 150 trees (that is, we don't see substantial gains from increeasing the number of trees above that value).

(8) In the lab, a classification tree was applied to the `Carseats` data set after converting `Sales` into a qualitative response variable. Now we will seek to predict `Sales` using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable.

(a) Split the data set into a training set and a test set.

```{r}
set.seed(1989)

carseats_train <- ISLR::Carseats %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 0.5)

carseats_test <- ISLR::Carseats %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  anti_join(carseats_train)
```

(b) Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. What test MSE do you obtain?

```{r, fig.asp=2, fig.width=13}
tree_carseats <- tree(Sales ~ . , data = carseats_train)

plot(tree_carseats)
text(tree_carseats, pretty = 0, srt=25)
```

Once again, the most important variable (top split) seems to be "Shelve Location". Then in both branches we see `Price` and `CompPrice` as important splitting variables: lower prices are asociated to more sales, as expected, but also lower prices of competitors imply lower sales of our own product.

Computing the Test MSE:
```{r}
carseats_test %>% 
  mutate(pred_sales = predict(tree_carseats, newdata = .),
         sq_error = (pred_sales - Sales)^2) %>% 
  summarise(test_mse = mean(sq_error))
```

(c) Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does pruning the tree improve the test MSE?

```{r}
cv_carseats <- cv.tree(tree_carseats)

qplot(cv_carseats$size, cv_carseats$dev, geom = "line") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cv_carseats$size[which.min(cv_carseats$dev)],
             color = "red")
```

The CV error decreases until as we add up to 12 nodes, then it barely changes. Therefore, we would not see significant gains in test MSE by pruning the tree, but we could reduce the complexity of the model without having to "pay a price" in terms of higher test MSE. I would prune the tree to leave it with 12 nodes.


(d) Use the bagging approach in order to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the `importance()` function to determine which variables are most important.

```{r}
bag_carseats <- randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = carseats_train,
                             mtry = 10, importance = TRUE)

carseats_test %>% 
  mutate(pred_sales = predict(bag_carseats, newdata = .),
         sq_error = (pred_sales - Sales)^2) %>% 
  summarise(mean(sq_error))
```

```{r}
importance(bag_carseats) %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "variable") %>% 
  arrange(desc(IncNodePurity))
```

(e) Use random forests to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the `importance()` function to determine which variables are most important. Describe the effect of $m$,the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained.

```{r}
get_mse_rf_carseats <- function(rf) {
  sales_pred <- 
    predict(rf, newdata = carseats_test)
  
  mean((sales_pred - carseats_test$Sales)^2)
}

rfs_carseats <- 
  tibble(
    m = seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1),
    rfs = map(m, ~randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = carseats_train,
                               mtry = .x, importance = TRUE)),
    mse = map_dbl(rfs, get_mse_rf_carseats)
  )

ggplot(rfs_carseats,
       aes(factor(m), mse, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = rfs_carseats$m[which.min(rfs_carseats$mse)],
             color = "red")

```

```{r}
rfs_carseats %>% 
  filter(m == 10) %>% 
  pull(rfs) %>% 
  magrittr::extract2(1) %>% 
  importance() %>% 
  as_tibble(rownames = "variable") %>% 
  arrange(desc(IncNodePurity))
```

When evaluating the Test MSE for different values of `mtry` we get that the lower Test MSE is achieved by using all the predictors at each split ($m = p$), which is equivalent to using bagging.

(9) This problem involves the `OJ` data set which is part of the `ISLR` package.


(a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations.

(b) Fit a tree to the training data, with `Purchase` as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use the `summary()` function to produce summary statistics about the tree, and describe the results obtained. What is the training error rate? How many terminal nodes does the tree have?

(c) Type in the name of the tree object in order to get a detailed text output. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and interpret the information displayed.

(d) Create a plot of the tree, and interpret the results.

(e) Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion matrix comparing the test labels to the predicted test labels. What is the test error rate?

(f) Apply the `cv.tree()` function to the training set in order to determine the optimal tree size.

(g) Produce a plot with tree size on the x-axis and cross-validated classification error rate on the y-axis.

(h) Which tree size corresponds to the lowest cross-validated classification error rate?

(i) Produce a pruned tree corresponding to the optimal tree size obtained using cross-validation. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned tree with five terminal nodes.

(j) Compare the training error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?

(k) Compare the test error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?
